# SculptER (Database Modelling Graphical Editor Tool)

SculptER is a prototype for a desktop application focused on visual modeling and diagram management. The goal is to establish a solid foundation using software modeling tools and structured development methodologies.
This project was developed as part of the Software specification and modelling course during the 3rd year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in East Sarajevo.

##  Project Status

 **Prototype Stage Only**  
This project is currently a non-functional visual prototype. It includes:
- UI mockups
- Software design models (SAP PowerDesigner)
- RUP-based documentation and templates

---

##  Purpose

The primary goal of SculptER is to design and prepare the structure for a fully-fledged desktop modeling tool. This includes:
- Defining system components using UML diagrams
- Planning development through Rational Unified Process (RUP)
- Structuring the application using proper software architecture patterns

##  Tools and Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SAP PowerDesigner** | UML modeling (use case, class diagrams, etc.) |
| **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** | Structured development methodology |
| **Java Swing (planned)** | Planned GUI framework |
| **Git/GitHub** | Version control and collaboration |

##  Design Patterns & Architecture

While this is only a prototype, the project is being designed with extendability and maintainability in mind. Planned concepts include:
- **MVC / MVP architectural patterns**
- **Component-based UI**
- Clear separation of concerns

##  Documentation

-  RUP Templates
-  PowerDesigner Models
-  Implementation Plan

##  What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to approach software development from a design-first perspective. I explored modeling tools like SAP PowerDesigner, worked with RUP templates, and planned a clean architectural structure. 
This process helped reinforce the importance of preparation and planning before jumping into code.
